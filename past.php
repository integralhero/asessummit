My experience with ASES 2013 has been the kind that has shaped my perspective of life. As a future entrepreneur and leader, the things I learned from the program and experiences I had exposed were overwhelming and life lessons to be learned. I was glad to be a part of ASES 2013 as one of the delegates from Cambodia. The reason I chose to participate in this international summit was not only to learn from the distinguished successful entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, but also to get engaged with other international delegates which brought me the sense of home during the summit. In positive way, I was privileged to have the opportunity to participate in such a great program.

I was fortunate to have the opportunity to represent India as a delegate at the ASES Stanford Summit 2013 and my experience was mesmerizing to say the least. I got to learn a lot from all the amazing people I met, be it my fellow delegates, the Stanford students, Professors or the vibrant Entrepreneurs and Investors. Also, the events, company tours, workshops, social activities and especially the Pitch Competition gave us tremendous exposure in a very short span of time, which has helped me ever since and I'm sure will always do to keep the spirit of entrepreneurship alive within me. Finally, thanks to Summit, I made a lot of new and wonderful friends whom I would cherish throughout life and congrats to the lovely student team for having organized such a wonderful week-long summit, you guys rock!

As a member of ASES-Zhejiang Chapter, it was my honor to participate in ASES Summit at Stanford in 2013. The enchanting campus, extremely friendly students, delectable food and most amazing ASES people all ascribed to one of the best experience I've ever had. We made friends with each other and the awesome photos of us were the best proof of our happiest time, right?  Moreover, we got to communicate face-to-face with young, experienced entrepreneurs and venture capitalists in Silicon Valley. The schedule was super intense because there was too many good stuff waiting for us to learn, to see and to try. My horizons were widely broadened and I was immersed in the passionate, inspiring and harmonious atmosphere. If I had another chance, I would love to come back to ASES Summit, to enjoy this great event again!
