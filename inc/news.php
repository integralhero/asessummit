		Summer planning has already begun for ASES Summit 2014! <BR>
		<BR>
		Leah and I are incredibly excited to bring you an unforgettable week in the upcoming spring. The rest of the ASES Summit team will start to come together as school starts in the upcoming weeks. Watch the "People" page over the next few weeks to see the lovely faces who will be doing the application processing, planning, and (for a lucky few) all of the programming behind Summit. <b>The ASES Summit 2014 application is now live!</b>
