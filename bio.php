		David is a Bay-Area native who is interested in developing additional platforms on which humans may engage with technology. He is a fan of the Golden State Warriors (go Dubs), and loves to shoot hoops when he's not coding. Recently, David has been learning a lot more about Ruby on Rails, and hopes to become better at rapid-prototyping. David is also in an a acapella group at Stanford University called <a href="www.raagapella.com">Raagapella</a>. In the Fall and Spring, David teaches CS classes at Stanford Splash!

	Leah recently embraced her Asian side and decided to devote herself to Computer Science. (She thought she was going to do Political Science.) And having the experience of doing absolutely nothing for ten months, she now enjoys being busy, whether it's about work or playing games. She loves everything related to ASES and hopes that ASES will one day become a global platform that connects future entrepreneurs.</p>
